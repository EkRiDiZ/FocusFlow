FocusFlow: ADHD & Dyslexia Friendly Reader
FocusFlow is a Chrome extension designed to make web content more accessible for users with ADHD and Dyslexia. It uses AI models from Hugging Face to simplify and reformat selected text on any webpage.

‚ú® Core Features
ADHD Mode: Summarizes long or complex passages of text into concise, easy-to-digest key points. This helps users grasp the main ideas without getting overwhelmed.

Dyslexia Mode: Rewrites selected text using simpler sentence structures and vocabulary. The output is then displayed in the OpenDyslexic font, a typeface specifically designed to improve readability for users with dyslexia.

‚öôÔ∏è How It Works
The extension works by:

Capturing the text you highlight on a webpage.

Sending the text to the Hugging Face AI Inference API for processing.

ADHD Mode uses the facebook/bart-large-cnn model for text summarization.

Dyslexia Mode uses the sshleifer/distilbart-cnn-12-6 model with a custom prompt to rewrite text in a simple, dyslexia-friendly format.

Displaying the simplified or summarized text back to you in the extension's popup window.
